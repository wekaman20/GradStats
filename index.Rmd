# **My Lab Journal**



Here are some instructions and notes on setting this up.
Note. I have had problems with the Git features of RStudio. 
Sometimes I make changes and the processes just hang there and nothing happens. I can't even shut down RStudio. Properly and if I shut it down, and re-open it the Git feature still seems to be running. To get everything to stop, I restart my whole computer and try again. It can be frustrating.

Need to run this
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "apupythonprojects", user.email = "apupythonprojects@gmail.com")

It is also necessary if signing in for the first time to Github or to a new account to do the following.

For Windows you can find the keys here:
control panel > user accounts > credential manager > Windows credentials > Generic credentials
Next, remove the Github keys.
In mac
1-In Finder, search for the Keychain Access app.
2In Keychain Access, search for github.com.
3-Find the "internet password" entry for github.com.
4-Edit or delete the entry accordingly.

Don't forget to Build Website before Git operations
